# Contributing

Please read carefully the guides for contributing to this project.


## Guidelines

1. Find a link to the resource you consider is awesome.
2. Search for already sent Pull Requests so there won't be any duplicate.
3. Add it to the proper category at the end of the list (two new).
4. Use format `* [name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
5. If there is no section for your resource but you thing there should be, then add it right before **Miscellaneous** category.
6. Check your spelling and grammar.
7. Send a Pull Request with the proper name and description (**Do not name Pull Request like "Update Readme.md"**).
8. Be patient. It may take a few days for me to review it.
